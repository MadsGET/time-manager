Project Name: Timemanager.
Description:
- I want a page to track my hours of worktime. This page will in addition to that be
  able to notify me when I need to take a break or finish for the day. Including this
  I want to be able to add silent hours where there is a set pause structure.

  Further more I want the ability to add tasks for the day, which I can mark as completed.

  There will be an option to view my total amount of hours in an 'overview' tab.
  A simple graph that will show either week, month and year. And the amount of time spent.
  Aswell as the total time spent on work. 
  (maybe silenthours = structured work time and can be two colored?)
